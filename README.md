# Advent of Code 2024

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).  
I have written my submissions in [Go](https://go.dev/).

You can find the solutions to each day in their respective files in their respective folder. In each file, there will be two public functions that will yield the specified solution as a string, given the input file in the same folder named `input.txt`. I also explained the idea behind the solution to each Part as comments in the respective files.

To run this, just use `go run`

```bash
$ go run .
```

(To let Go run the module in the current folder, use the location `.` when running `go run`)
